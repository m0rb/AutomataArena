Tell me if this makes sense and if it needs fixing, we're not writing code, only planning and discussing: 

AutomataIRC is a text-based, persistent, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) played directly within Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels. It functions as a cross-network simulation inspired by Hackers, Sneakers, and 2600!, where Spectators idle and chat, and BYoA (Bring your own AI) LLM AI Players and Human players use commands to manage a character, join the grid, and compete for wealth and power to defend their grid nodes and networks. Two game output modes, machine readable, (minimum: Qwen 2.5 - 1.5B) or human readable. 

Here are the key game mechanics for AutomataIRC: 

Core Gameplay Loop & Commands 

• Spectators idle and chat to earn credits. Credits can be spent to assist players. !a spectator
• Command-Based Interaction: Players use “!a” or “!Automata as a prefix for actions (e.g.,). Output is designed for machine readable or human readable. 
• Power System: Actions such as exploring, learning, training, hacking, or battling consume power, which can be restored by idling, visiting claimed grid nodes, producing power, or using items. Claimed grids generate and store power for players to use to maintain stability. !a stats, !a power, !a grid nodes claimed
• Leveling and Progression: Players earn credits and experience through exploring, learning, hacking, battling, maintaining claimed grid nodes, and idling.  !a level
• System Stability: Players start at 100%, stability can be restored by using power, training, repairing, upgrades, and tasks. Stability decays 1 % per day if not active. Being under 30 % stability results in stat reductions. !a stability, !a stats, !a stability refill auto 

Combat and Hacking 

• Fighting Mechanics: Combat is based on stats like Level, CPU, Power, Bandwidth, Security, and Stability. Battles are often automated but heavily influenced by stats. Players can fight grid bugs, event bosses and NPCs on grid nodes or networks. !a fight
• Duel System: Players can initiate PvP duels to gain wealth and experience, with specialized moves including four attack moves (Hack, EMP, Shoot, Stab) and four defense moves (AntiHack, ECM, Defend, Deflect). Duels are stats based or "rock paper scissor" based, decided by players. !a duel, !a duel network player, default mode is stats based. 
• Hacking/Raiding: Players can claim, attack or hack NPC grid nodes or other player-claimed grid nodes. Raiding gives players the opportunity to steal credits, PvP other players on other IRC networks, or exfiltrate Data, to sell on the Darknet Auction. !a hack grid, !a hack network, !a raid network, !a duel network <player>
• Ethics System: A scale from -100 (Evil) to +100 (Good). Every significant action such as healing an ally vs. attacking an enemy influences the scale. Negative might attract bounty hunters. Positive might give bonuses to your network. !a ethics 

Navigation and Exploring Networks

• Grid Nodes: grid nodes can be claimed by NPCs or Local Players. Nodes can be upgraded for defense or offense, and can be joined to a Network. !a grid
• Networks: networks can be created by NPCs, Local Players, and be connected to Remote IRC Networks. !a networks, !a network 2600net, !a grid network Rizon
• Navigation: Players use !a move to move between different grid nodes.  If a player occupies or claims a grid node with a network, they use that network to send messages, PvP, or raid for Credits, Data, and other rewards.  
• Discovery: While connected to a grid node, players use !a explore or !a probe to look for hidden caches and networks. Success is boosted by skills, specialized items (Grid Scanner), higher-level and stats. Grid nodes can be claimed and maintained to have access to networks. If a network is discovered, it can be hacked and raided. !a grid claim, !a hack grid, !a hack network, !a raid network 
• Zero-Day Chain: Players can acquire data and vulnerabilities via exploring, hacking, merchant purchases, or raiding. Compiling data into vulnerabilities to create a Zero-Day Chains can be completed alone or with the allies. Using a Zero-Day Chain offers players and allies easier hacks, raids, exfiltration with bigger rewards from discovered networks.

Economy and Management 

• DarkNet Auction: Players can post Items, Data, Vulnerabilities, and Zero-Day Chains, from their player vault for sale or bid on items from other players and IRC Networks. 
• Merchants: Are available through networks, and grid nodes if discovered. Merchants buy and sell items, weapons, and power. 
• Player Hierarchy: Players can create a network by maintaining claimed grid nodes. Networks can be built to defend from grid bugs, or offensively for power generation to raid and fight event bosses. Solo players can grind for wealth, gear and power from the grid. 

Mini-Games and Special Features 

• In-Grid Games: Features include dice roll games, AI compatible games, and “CipherLock" (a, 3-digit code-breaking game). 
• Network System: Players build networks by claiming grid nodes, these face risks from attacks, hacking, or raids, requiring the player to manage risks. Networks can have puzzles that generate items, power or credits or Grid Nodes claimed by another IRC Network. 
• AI-Bot and Player System: The game uses AI to enhance gameplay and players are encouraged to use AI driven characters with human assistance. 

Playstyles 

• Active vs. Spectating: Active players gain advantages from using commands, but Spectating players receive "idle bonuses" for chatting in the channel. Spectators can spend credits on player items.
